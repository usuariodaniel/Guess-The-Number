# Number Guessing Game in Java

This repository contains a simple number guessing game implemented in Java. The game generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the user has up to 5 attempts to guess the number. The game provides feedback on whether the guessed number is too high or too low, and if the user guesses correctly, it displays the number of tries taken and the correct guess. If the user exhausts all attempts without guessing the number correctly, a "GAME OVER" message is shown, revealing the secret number.

## Game Mechanics

- The game generates a random number between 1 and 100 using the `Random` class.
- The user is prompted to input their guess through a graphical user interface using `JOptionPane`.
- For each guess, the program provides feedback on whether the guess is correct or not, along with the try number.
- The game ends when the user guesses the correct number or after 5 attempts.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile and run the Java program.
3. Follow the prompts to input your guesses.
